/**
  * Example of a controlled initialized through FXML.
  *
  * When working with FXML, due to the nature of JavaFX FXMLLoader, we need to expose variables and methods that
  * FXMLLoader will be using with JavaFX signatures.
  *
  * The FXMLLoader injects JavaFX objects as values of member variables marked with annotation `@jfxf.FXML`.
  * We need to declare those variables using JavaFX types (not ScalaFX types).
  * We can use those variables directly or wrap them in ScalaFX objects.
  * Here, for the sake of illustration, we only wrap one variable `gridDelegate` (it is not strictly necessary).
  * The most convenient place to do wrapping is in the overloaded method `initialize`. It is executed after
  * FXMLLoader injects its objects.
  *
  * We can rely on ScalaFX "magic" to use ScalaFX methods on variables that were not explicitly wrapped.
  * All we need to do is to "summon the magic" using "import scalafx.Includes._".
  * This is demonstrated in method "handleClear" where we access properties on
  * JavaFX objects using ScalaFX way, no `get` or `set` involved.
  *
  * Methods annotated with `@jfxf.FXML`, that will be wired to event handlers by FLXMLoader.
  * They need to use JavaFX method signatures. This is illustrated in methods: `handleSubmit` and  `handleClear`.
  *
  * In the rest of the code we can use ScalaFX, for instance, to create more in the event handlers or bind
  * properties.
